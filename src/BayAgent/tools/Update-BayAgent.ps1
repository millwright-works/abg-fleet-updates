Update-BayAgent.ps1

Purpose
- Download a versioned BayAgent zip from HTTPS (e.g., GitHub Releases)
- Verify SHA256
- Expand into:   C:\AllBirdies\BayAgent\releases\<version>\
- Promote into:  C:\AllBirdies\BayAgent\current\
- Sign installed scripts (BayAgent.ps1 and any .ps1/.psm1/.psd1 in current) to satisfy AllSigned,
  RFC 3161 timestamped so the signature outlives the signing certificate's own expiry
- Optionally request restart by writing: C:\AllBirdies\BayAgent\control\restart.host

ZIP structure supported:
A) Files at root (BayAgent.ps1, manifest.json, etc.)
B) A single top-level folder containing those files
(Anything deeper than one folder is not recommended.)

Typical usage (via StartProcess BayCommand):

  powershell.exe -NoProfile -File "C:\AllBirdies\BayAgent\tools\Update-BayAgent.ps1" `
    -Version "1.1.8" `
    -PackageUrl "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/<tag>/BayAgent-1.1.8.zip" `
    -Sha256 "<sha256>" `
    -RequestRestart

PACKAGE HOSTING -- GitHub Releases, no authentication
  PackageUrl must be an HTTPS URL that needs no credentials. All three fleet packages
  (BayAgent, SessionDisplay, PromosPack) are hosted as GitHub Release assets and are
  fetched with a plain Invoke-WebRequest, exactly as Update-SessionDisplay.ps1 and
  Update-PromosPack.ps1 have always done.

  Dataverse file-column hosting is RETIRED. It required a Bearer token handed over in
  control\dvtoken.tmp plus MSCRMCallerID / CallerObjectId impersonation headers, because
  an S2S (client_credentials) token cannot read a file column directly. That in turn
  forced prvActOnBehalfOfAnotherUser at GLOBAL scope onto the ABG Bay AGent role -- a
  standing privilege to act as any user in the org, held by an unattended kiosk PC, for
  the sole purpose of fetching a zip. Moving the package to GitHub removes the need for
  the token, the impersonation headers and the privilege.

INTEGRITY IS UNCHANGED BY THIS MOVE
  What protects the fleet is the SHA256 check below plus the Authenticode signing pass
  that follows it -- not the transport. The package bytes are identical whichever host
  serves them, so the expected hash does not change when hosting moves. A tampered or
  truncated download fails the hash and the script throws before anything is staged.
